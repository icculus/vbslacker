To start:
    Basic modules should be converted to ".CC" files. This will allow
    C++ to be used in the future, and C++ startup code to be inserted
    for use by GUI frontends.

    All modules generated by BASIClib should #include "BasicLib.h"
    Note the capitalization.

    The mainline should look something like this:

    int main(int _argc, char **_argv)
    {
        void *_base;
        __getBasePointer(_base);
        __initBasicLib(_base, _argc, _argv);
        __userMainline();
        return(0);          /* !!! What should this REALLY return? */
    }

    __userMainline() may be a separate function, or may inlined into main()
    by the BASIC compiler. Either is acceptable. (Let's avoid the C "inline"
    keyword as much as possible, since it isn't forceful enough for our uses.)


Comments:
    Comments should be stripped from the BASIC source file, and should not
    be included in the C output. (If someone were to use a "/*" or "*/" in
    their own comments it would confuse the C compiler)


SUBs and FUNCTIONs:
    SUBs and FUNCTIONs in BASIC will convert directly to ANSI C format
    functions. That is to say that the format of the C output will not follow
    K&R-style C function syntax, for example. The BASIC mainline (which does
    NOT land between SUB/END SUB statements) will be fitted into either the C
    mainline (main()), or will be fitted into a C void function of standard
    naming (__userMainline will suffice in such an event; almost anything we
    can standardize upon with an underscore at the start will suffice, though.)


Identifiers:
    Every identifier that we insert in the C output should have at least one
    "_" before it. BASIC identifiers can have underscores in them, but may
    not start with one, and the parser should throw an error if they do. This
    prevents namespace clashing, and (I think) is how actual BASICs function.


Name mangling:
    Refer to name_mangling.txt in the repository (/vbslacker/docs directory)
    for how BASIC API calls should be formatted. End user BASIC identifiers
    should be completely lowercased, but otherwise named identically to its
    BASIC counterpart. The exception to this rule are line labels, which
    should be serialized as _line0, _line1, _line2, etc...and C-unfriendly
    characters (like "varname$"), which is also covered in name_mangling.txt...

    Identifiers >= 32 characters in the BASIC code should throw a
    WARNING currently, but compilation should still be attempted. ANSI C
    only considers the first 31 characters of an identifier significant,
    but that's not to say specific compilers won't permit more; perhaps a
    BASIC compiler option to enable/disable this warning for various platforms?


BASIC intrinsic data types:
    Intrinsic data types in BASIC convert to C-style variables directly.
    They are wrapped in typedefs, to guarantee the correct size (so
    __integer is always 16-bits on any given platform, for example. int,
    short, and long are not constant between platforms or compilers.)

    INTEGER     __integer
    LONG        __long
    SINGLE      __single
    DOUBLE      __double
    BOOLEAN     __boolean
    BYTE        __byte


BASIC complex data types:
    !!! more.


BASIC arrays:


GOTOs and Line labels:
    Any line labels in BASIC code will translate like this:

    cheesypoof:
      --becomes--
    __insertLineLabel(cheesypoof);

    GOTO cheesypoof:
      --becomes--
    __jumpLabel(cheesypoof);

    This is all made more complicated by the fact that in any given module,
    the same line label name cannot appear more than once. (since on
    platforms that generate inline assembly for the __insertLineLabel
    macro, this will cause a namespace clash at assembly time.) Therefore,
    "cheesypoof", above, would have to be translated into "line342" or
    whatever. The parser should keep track of this per module, and should
    increment its counter whenever an __insertLineLabel macro is used. This is
    consistent with how C and BASIC treat line labels internally, since labels
    are never accessible outside their given function.

    __insertLineLabel is needed in three places:
        - In replacement of user-generated BASIC line labels.
        - Between every line of BASIC code (NOT EVERY FUNCTION, JUST EVERY
          LINE...lines continued with the '_' character still count as one
          line) in functions that contain any mention of ON ERROR or RESUME.
        - The line after every GOSUB statement.

    The C-output should NEVER contain C-style line labels or gotos, since they
    aren't portable between platforms (at least, not for our needs).

    When necessary, we must label each separate line of BASIC code. That is:

    Print "hello world!"
    Print "My Name is " + _
          "Mudd."

    would need:

    __insertLineLabel(_line0);
    vbPrint("Hello world!")
    __insertLineLabel(_line1);
    vbPrint("My Name is " + "Mudd.");

    (Note that the vbPrint syntax is wrong, but the label thing is right.
     The reason for this labelling will become clear later.)


BASIC math:
    Simple math like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
    is done with the equivalent C operator. Most other math is performed
    through the BASIC API, which is abstracted in the normal ways in BASIClib.
    I think. Is that all?


Order of operations:
    !!! more.


Overflow:
    If the "check for overflow" option is DISABLED, then output is not altered.
    If overflow checking is enabled, then a conditional must wrap every
    assignment to a numeric.
    !!! more.

    !!! more.


GOSUB and RETURN:
    If a GOSUB or RETURN is encountered, then in that functions' variable
    declaration section, this must appear:

    __GOSUBVARS;

    Any GOSUB statements will translate like this:

    GOSUB buttcrack
      --becomes--
    __doGosub(buttCrack, retLabel);
    __insertLineLabel(retLabel);

        where (buttCrack) is the parameter to a __insertLineLabel() macro
         somewhere in that function, and (retLabel) is the next line of
         BASIC code, denoted by an __insertLineLabel() macro.


    RETURN        ' (or RETURN 0)
      --becomes--
    __doReturn;

    RETURN toMyLabel
      --becomes--
    __doReturnLabel(toMyLabel);


    "RETURN without GOSUB" errors are generated at runtime and are not
    checked by the compiler. I think.


ON ERROR and RESUME statements:
    If an ON ERROR or RESUME statement is encountered, then in that functions'
    variable declaration section, this must appear:

    __ONERRORVARS;

    ...and the first statement following the variable section should be:

    __ONERRORINIT;

    ...before every line of BASIC code is an __insertLineLabel(lineX) macro
    that allows us to keep track of where each physical line of BASIC code
    begins and ends.

    ...also before every line of BASIC code is a macro to update the pointers
    of where RESUME and RESUME NEXT commands will go. Like so:

    __setInstructs(zeroLabel, nextLabel);

        Where "zeroLabel" is the label of the line a RESUME 0 command should
        jump to, and "nextLabel" is the label of the line a RESUME NEXT command
        should jump to.

    ON ERROR GOTO label
      --becomes--
    __setOnErrorHandler(label);


ON ERROR RESUME NEXT:
    These follow the rules of ON ERROR above, but come out like this:

    void myFunc(void)
    {
        __ONERRORVARS;
        __ONERRORINIT;
        __setOnErrorHandler(resumeNextLabel);
        /* ...your code... */
        __exitCleanupOnError;
        return;
        __insertResumeNextHandler(resumeNextLabel);
    }

    (resumeNextLabel), of course, would be lineN...

    ...if the only ON ERROR and RESUME command in a given function is a
    ON ERROR RESUME NEXT command, the __insertLineLabel() and
    __setOnErrorHandler() macros do not need to be used between each line of
    BASIC code, but while it will bloat the binary a little, it shouldn't hurt
    anything. I think.

    The __insertResumeNextHandler() macro just sets up a line label and a
    __resumeNext call. This could be effectively duplicated in BASIC code as
    such:

    SUB FEH
        ON ERROR GOTO RESUMENEXTHANDLER
        ' My code...
        EXIT SUB
        RESUMENEXTHANDLER:
        RESUME NEXT
    END SUB

    ...there's a reason we're called vbSLACKER, after all.  :)


ON ERROR GOTO 0:
    Same as On Error Goto label, but the macro is

    __setOnErrorHandlerOff;

    You don't need to label every line and use __setInstructs(), unless
    there are other RESUME or ON ERROR statements in the functions.


Threading:
    The BASIC API has no direct Thread manipulation routines, but C code
    that is part of vbSlacker has a very well-defined API. Refer to threads.txt
    in the /vbslacker/docs directory for details. BASIClib is thread safe when
    compiled in _REENTRANT mode. Single threaded apps can use the multithreaded
    BASIClib transparently (but with a slight performance hit that the single-
    threaded BASIClib should not have). Multithreaded apps will not link with
    a single-threaded BASIClib.


Debugging code:
    This section has yet to be considered fully, but there will be extra code
    inserted into the C output when debugging support is enabled. The extra
    code will allow for tracing of code flow and variable contents.
