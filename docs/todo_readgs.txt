MY FIRST GOAL IS TO NOT KEEP THIS PROJECT ON A VFAT PARTITION.
MY SECOND GOAL IS ALSO TO NOT KEEP THIS PROJECT ON A VFAT PARTITION.

How we love ext2. 
We love not having source code files with the executable bit set.
We love case-sensitive filenames.

parser
   -"unreferenced main" error when bulding right now.
   -error/exception handling (better than default)
   -makefile for win32
   -makefile for ANTLR should build a single .o file.
   -ANTLR generated code tends to generate a lot of useless warnings.  This
    needs to be fixed...either by #pragma, or other.
   -The parser executable seems a bit big.  No doubt this is due to linking
    with the ANTLR libraries.  Maybe they can be shrunken down a bit???
   -Some minor type checking is done at parse time...i.e. "Dim WithEvents A As
    Integer" will barf at parse time because you can't handle events of the type
    Integer.
   -get it working.
