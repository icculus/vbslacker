Q: On startup, I get this message:

  Init error (#17) has been thrown. Aborting...

(or something similar) What gives?

A: You need to put vbslacker.lang somewhere where BASIClib can find it.
Either put it in your home dir, export VBHOME=/dir/with/vbslacker.lang/,
or put it in /etc ...Other errors usually signify that the langfile is too
short or corrupted. Get a fresh copy out of the latest vbslacker tarball.
