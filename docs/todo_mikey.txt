(mikey's) TODO list:

- Make vbslacker.cons parser handle multiple spaces.
- Check entire codebase for "//" comments.
- Put const qualifier wherever you can.
- Split console drivers into individual shared libraries that are
  loaded/unloaded dynamically, in a config-file-specified hierarchy.
- Check all code for possible replacements with _vbReleaseThreadThrowError().
- errors should be their own type? Short?
- autoconf.
- __crashHandler();
- re-mangle all BASIClib symbols. AGAIN. Ugh.
- BasicString needs to become __vbString ...
- PBasicString needs to become __vbString * ...
- Variant needs to become __vbVariant ...
- PVariant needs to become __vbVariant * ...
- Other constants need modifying...
- What to do about: ActiveX  (_vbComponent?)
- What to do about all the damned constants?
- What to do about variants?
- FileSystemFunctions: FileDateTime(), FileLen(), GetAttr(),
- Figure out data types.
- vbs output specs.
- revise name mangling; variable arguments?
- finish tracing randomizing stuff...
- Write signal handlers...
- Complete console drivers.
- Catch up testlib, in general.
- RESUME NEXT recursive testing.
- Streamline makefiles. Most of it is just duplication. Autoconf?
- Examine/eliminate the "!!!" comments in the source.
- Eliminate #warnings in the source, as well.
- DON'T FORGET TO WRITE TESTLIB CODE FOR ALL IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS!
- Check lists at end of each module for completely unimplemented APIs.
  Do something about these.
- Consider how to implement READ/DATA/RESTORE
- Design full, detailed timetable.
- Consider marketing strategy.
- Write the !@#$ing thing.
- Slow down a bit so Greg can catch up. :)
- ...and much, much more.
