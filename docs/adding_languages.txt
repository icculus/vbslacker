vbSlacker was designed and written by English-speaking people.

If you want vbSlacker to output German, Spanish, or whatever, you'll
need to do some translating.

To add a new language to BASIClib, take the file English.h, and translate
it. These are all the string literals in the program. There are directions
in the file on how to do this. Rename the file to German.h (or whatever),
and mail it back to the vbSlacker development team, currently residing at
ryan_gordon@hotmail.com. They will plug it into the Language.h file, and
add it to the distribution.

Please note that you will be credited for your work, but otherwise not
compensated. Immortality in the "contributions" documentation is all
we can offer; sorry.

!!! This will change with the BASIClibLang file...
