vbSlacker was designed and written by English-speaking people.

If you want vbSlacker to output German, Spanish, or whatever, you'll
need to do some translating.

To add a new language to BASIClib, take the file vbslacker.lang, and translate
it. These are all the string literals in the program. There are directions
in the file on how to do this. Then mail it back to the vbSlacker development
team, currently residing at ryan_gordon@hotmail.com. They will plug it into
the Language.h file, and add it to the distribution.

Please note that you will be credited for your work, but otherwise not
compensated. Immortality in the "contributions" documentation is all
we can offer; sorry.
