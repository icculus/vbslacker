-GNU only supports SHARED or EXCLUSIVE locks.  This does not satisfy VB's
 requirements for READ/WRITE/READWRITE locks.  Both GNU locks still allow
 other processes to READ the file.  SUCKS!!!!
-Why a '?' is added to a file when opened (atleast in initial testlib).
-A decent way of testing for file existence.
