TODO list:

- Make current BASIClib code use the boxcar system, where applicable.
- Rewrite testlib code to use new name-mangling scheme.
- HOWTO on adding new modules to BASIClib.
- RESUME NEXT recursive testing.
- Testlib code for boxcar system.
- Catch up testlib, in general.
- Documentation: mem_management.txt and on_events.txt
- Streamline makefiles. Most of it is just duplication.
- Find good way to generate dependencies.
- Examine/eliminate the "!!!" comments in the source.
- Eliminate #warnings in the source, as well.
- GOSUB/RETURN support.
- DON'T FORGET TO WRITE TESTLIB CODE FOR ALL IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS!
- For greg: file i/o functions. NOT FILE SYSTEM FUNCS LIKE MKDIR,ETC...
- For ryan: finish conversion, and time/date functions.
- For ryan: READ/DATA/RESTORE
- For someone: Environment functions (chdir, environ set...)
- For someone: process functions: shell, end, sleep, etc...
- For someone: Array functions (lbound, redim, etc...)
- For someone: Console stuff (print, window, cls, color, locate)
- For the daring: Sounds (beep, sound, play)
- For the daring: stick, strig, and ON STRIG. Joystick API. Ugh. :)
- For the daring: screen procedure and various graphics primitives...
- For the daring: com port i/o (COM, ON COM, OPEN COM, etc...)
- Other miscelleanea: SWAP
- Design full, detailed timetable.
- Consider marketing strategy.
- Write the !@#$ing thing.
- ...and much, much more.
