TODO list:

- OnEvents should properly handle NULLSTATEARGS.
- Make current BASIClib code use the boxcar system, where applicable.
- HOWTO on adding new modules to BASIClib.
- RESUME NEXT recursive testing.
- Testlib code for boxcar system.
- Documentation: mem_management.txt and on_events.txt
- Streamline makefiles. Most of it is just duplication.
- Find good way to generate dependencies.
- Examine the "!!!" comments in the source.
- GOSUB/RETURN support.
- Implement BASIC arrays.
- DON'T FORGET TO WRITE TESTLIB CODE FOR ALL IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS!

- For someone: Randomosity functions (RANDOMIZE and RND...)
- For the daring: Sounds (beep, sound, play)
- For the daring: stick, strig, and ON STRIG. Joystick API. Ugh. :)
- For the daring: screen procedure and various graphics primitives...
- Other miscelleanea: SWAP, TAB
