TODO list:

- Put StdBasic.h in dependencies...
- Complete console drivers.
- Catch up testlib, in general.
- Move RANDOMIZE and RND from MathFunctions to a new module
  (RandomNumberFunctions) ?
- Make current BASIClib code use the boxcar system, where applicable.
- RESUME NEXT recursive testing.
- Documentation: mem_management.txt and on_events.txt
- Streamline makefiles. Most of it is just duplication.
- Examine/eliminate the "!!!" comments in the source.
- Eliminate #warnings in the source, as well.
- GOSUB/RETURN support.
- DON'T FORGET TO WRITE TESTLIB CODE FOR ALL IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS!
- Check lists at end of each module for completely unimplemented APIs.
  Do something about these.
- Consider how to implement READ/DATA/RESTORE
- For the daring: com port i/o (COM, ON COM, OPEN COM, etc...)
- Design full, detailed timetable.
- Consider marketing strategy.
- Write the !@#$ing thing.
- ...and much, much more.
