VBslacker 0.0.1

Designed with tender loving care by Ryan C. Gordon and Gregory S Read.

vbSlacker is currently being hacked at on Linux in this specification:
  - Red Hat 6.2
  - glibc2.1.2
  - kernel 2.4.0-testsomething.
  - ELF-binaries.

(Also being hacked on WinNT 4.0 by Greg, and Win98 and Slackware 7 on Ryan's
 VAIO N505VE...whoa.)

Win32 support is in place in...uh...some places, thanks to CygWin.

Warranty: If vbSlacker breaks, you get to keep both SHINY pieces!
