VBslacker 0.0.1

Designed with tender loving care by Ryan C. Gordon and Gregory S Read.

vbSlacker is currently being hacked at on Linux in this specification:
  - Red Hat 5.2
  - glibc2.
  - kernel 2.2.6
  - ELF-binaries.

Win32 support is in place in...uh...most places, thanks to cygwin B20.1.


Warranty: If vbSlacker breaks, you get to keep both SHINY pieces!


(If you are seeing this when running MAKE, you probably need to
 specify a target platform. Try: 'make linux' or 'make win32'...)
