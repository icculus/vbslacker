VBslacker 0.0.1

Designed with tender loving care by Ryan C. Gordon and Gregory S Read.

vbSlacker is currently being hacked at on Linux in this specification:
  - Red Hat 6.1
  - glibc2.1
  - kernel 2.2.13
  - ELF-binaries.

(Also being hacked on WinNT 4.0 by Greg, and Win98 and Slackware 7 on Ryan's
 VAIO N505VE...whoa.)

Win32 support is in place in...uh...most places, thanks to cygwin B20.1.

Warranty: If vbSlacker breaks, you get to keep both SHINY pieces!


(If you are seeing this when running MAKE, you probably need to
 specify a target platform. Try: 'make linux' or 'make win32'...)
