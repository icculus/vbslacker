VBslacker 0.0.1

Designed with tender loving care by Ryan C. Gordon and Gregory S Read.

This is currently being hacked at on Linux in this specification:
  - kernel 2.0.36pre8.
  - ELF-binaries.
  - Red Hat 5.1
  - glibc.

Win32 support is in place in...uh...some places.

 If it breaks, you get to keep both SHINY pieces!


(If you are seeing this when running MAKE, you probably need to
 specify a target platform. Try: 'make linux' or 'make win32'...)
