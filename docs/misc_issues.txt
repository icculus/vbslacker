-What do we do when we generate a runtime error?  In the case of FreeFile()
 we need to return out of the function...but NOT assign a return value.
 Can this be done?
-VB does overrange checking on arguments...for example, if a function requires
 a 'short' and the value passed was 40000, then the function would generate a
 runtime error.  However, in C the value would simply get wrapped.
