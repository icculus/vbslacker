# vbSlacker

An abandoned attempt to build an open source Visual Basic.

This is meant to be a compiler/runtime library for legacy BASIC code.
The goal was to support most of the syntax and API of Qbasic,
QuickBASIC 4.5, and the earlier Visual Basics.

It was intended to compile to native code, and the runtime was to be
C-callable, albeit with some weird macros and inline asm to handle the
stack and registers.

This project is currently not being worked on, and probably won't be
again. It was interesting to poke at as an undergrad, but this never
got to the point of being usable. But hey, send patches!
