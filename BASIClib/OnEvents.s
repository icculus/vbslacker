#

.global __callOnEventHandler 

# This procedure copies the stack from event handling procedure to top
#  of stack, calls event handler, and deals with returns. Neet, huh?
#
# The stack is copied to fool the called address into thinking it is
#  executing as normal, with access to all variables, both arguments and
#  local, as they were originally. Before calling the handler, we patch
#  the copied stack so the return address will be in this procedure. This
#  allows us to clean up and return the stack to its normal state. Also,
#  This allows us to "skip" any functions called between the handler's
#  procedure and where the event was triggered, so their stack space isn't
#  overwritten. We need to protect that data in case of a RESUME NEXT.
#
# The proper element in basePtrIndexes is decremented to allow memory
#  shrinkage. See comments for basePtrStacks's declaration in OnEvents.c
#  for a more detailed explanation as to why.
#
# This doesn't preserve any registers, since we are going to be hopping
#  down the stack to previous procedures that want THEIR preserved
#  registers returned. That is taken care of by other code.
#
#     params : POnEventHandler of handler to call at [esp + 4].
#    returns : any return value from BASIC routine in EAX.

#  the stack at the point of the latest call to that function. In short,
#  it's like returning from __callOnEventHandler, but we go back to where
#  the OnEvent was triggered, instead of the function that called the
#  function with the error handler. Yikes. That's pretty complex for five
