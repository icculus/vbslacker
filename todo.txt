TODO list:

- Examine the "!!!" and "***" comments in the source.
- Implement BASIC arrays.
- For greg: design the file i/o abstraction layer.
- For ryan: finish conversion, math, and time/date functions.
- For ryan: finish On event handling. Ugh.
- For ryan: write internal string functions.
- For the daring: See how gcc for win32 like this code.  :)
- debug the ASM code. Yikes. Maybe move it into an inline
   function in OnEvents.c ...
- Write a Makefile.
- Start developing a portable, clean, test program that alerts us to
   errors in expected BASIClib functionality. We'll really need this
   if we start porting to other platforms, but this is important for
   initial debugging, too.
- Design full, detailed  timetable.
- Write the !@#$ing thing.
- ...and much, much more.
