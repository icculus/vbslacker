To build the parser, the following is required...

   ANTLR-2.6.1
   JDK v1.1.x (probably v1.2 will work also, but untested)

By default, the Makefile looks for the existence of ANTLR in ~/antlr-2.6.1.
For now, just put it there and deal with it.  Be sure to check the ./antlr
folder for instructions on how to build the ANTLR package.

Also, I originally used the -classpath argument to specify the ANTLR folder
so that java would run the grammar compiler.  The java that I have crashes
for some reason when I use this, so for now you'll have to specify the
ANTLR folder in your CLASSPATH environment manually. DON'T USE THE ANTLR.JAR FILE!  THIS IS OUT OF DATE!  Use the classes inside the antlr subfolder instead.
